# CodeBERTScore
This is the official implementation of the paper:

Shuyan Zhou, Uri Alon, Sumit Agarwal, Graham Neubig, [CodeBERTScore: Evaluating Code Generation with Pretrained Models of Code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05527.pdf)

CodeBERTScore is an Automatic Evaluation Metric for Code, based on [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675).
This repository is based on the code of [BERTScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score), and we are grateful to the authors for releasing their code.

## Example:

![](./images/example.png "Example")

Figure (a) shows a reference code snippet in Java. Figures (b) and (c) show two generated predictions. Among these two candidates and given the reference, BLEU prefers (scores higher) the code in (b), which is not functionally equivalent to the reference, while CodeBERTScore prefers the code in (c), which is functionaly equivalent to the reference.

## How does it work?

![](./images/flow.png "Example")

As BERTScore, CodeBERTScore leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from a model such as CodeBERT and matches
words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity.
Differently from BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes natural language input or other context along with the generated code, but does not use that context to compute cosine similarities.

This example shows how CodeBERTScore can compute the similarity between the Python expressions `x ** 0.5` and `math.sqrt(x)`, which are functionally equivalent, even though they have very few overlapping tokens.



## Usage
```
import code_bert_score
pred_results = code_bert_score.score(cands=predictions, refs=refs, lang='python')
```
Where `pred_results` is a 4-tuple of `(precision, recall, F1, F3)`, where each is a 1-D tensor of scores for each prediction-reference pair. `F3` is similar to the well-known `F1` score, that considers recall 3 times as important as precision. See the [definition on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score#F%CE%B2_score).

## Additional Features

* We found that sometimes more accurate results are achieved using the `no_punc=True` argument, that encodes the *entire* inputs, but measures the similarity only non-punctuation and non-whitespace tokens:

```
pred_results = code_bert_score.score(cands=predictions, refs=refs, lang='python', no_punc=True)
```

* We found that in NL->Code problems, more accurate results are achieved by encoding the NL source with the code prediction, but then measuring similarity only for the encoded code:

```
pred_results = code_bert_score.score(cands=predictions, refs=refs, lang='python', sources=sources)
```

* We also found that using Inverse Document Frequencies improve the results, similarly to the original BERTScore. We included an example script that shows how to precompute them here [compute_idf.py](compute_idf.py). Then, the resulting dictionary can be used with the argument `idf=idf_dict`.

* Tuning the layer that the similarity is computed from is also helpful, using `num_layers=N` where `N` is between 5-9.

See also our [example.py](./example.py) and the original BERTScore [demo notebook](./example/Demo.ipynb).

## Backend Model
We fine-tuned the `microsoft/codebert-base-mlm` model for 1,000,000 steps (with `batch_size=32`) on several languages separately.

We released the following models to the Huggingface hub:
* `anonymized/codebert-python` (the default model for `lang='python'`)
* `anonymized/codebert-javascript` (the default model for `lang='javascript'` or `'js'`)
* `anonymized/codebert-c` (the default model for `lang='c'`)
* `anonymized/codebert-cpp` (the default model for `lang='cpp'` or `'c++'`)
* `anonymized/codebert-java` (the default model for `lang='java'`)

all other languages currently use the `microsoft/codebert-base-mlm` model.

## Training
The [`run_mlm.py`](./run_mlm.py) script can be used to fine-tune the base model `microsoft/codebert-base-mlm` on specific languages.

## Human Evaluation

We find that CodeBERTScore is more correlated with human preference compared to a variety of common metrics. See more details in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05527.pdf).
